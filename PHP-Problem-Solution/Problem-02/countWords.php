    /* Problem 2:
    Given a few paragraphs in a file, read the file and count how many words are there.
    For example, if there is a file with the following contents:
    Nunc ex lorem, ullamcorper ut eleifend ac, pellentesque non dolor.
    You need to output: 10
    Because there are 10 words.
    Note: There can be multiple paragraphs. You need to count all of the words from all of the
    paragraphs.
    You need to read the data from a file. */
